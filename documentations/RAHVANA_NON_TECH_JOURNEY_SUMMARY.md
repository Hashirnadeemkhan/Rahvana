# Rahvana: Non-Technical Journey Summary

## 1) What Rahvana Does
Rahvana is a guided immigration platform that helps users move from confusion to action by combining:
- A step-by-step visa journey map
- Smart preparation tools
- Document organization
- Human support services

The goal is simple: help families complete the U.S. immigration process with fewer mistakes, better preparation, and clear progress tracking.

## 2) How Rahvana Works (End-to-End in 7 Steps)
1. **User starts and sets profile**
User signs up, adds basic case details, and opens their immigration workspace.

2. **User selects a journey**
User picks the visa path and enters a guided roadmap.  
Current primary live journey: **IR-1 / CR-1 (Spouse of U.S. Citizen)**.

3. **Rahvana gives a step-by-step plan**
Each stage is broken into clear actions with timelines, required documents, and role clarity (Petitioner vs Beneficiary).

4. **User prepares with tools**
User uses built-in tools (case strength checker, visa bulletin checker, interview prep, PDF/photo/signature tools, form autofill) to complete tasks faster.

5. **User organizes documents in one place**
Document Vault stores and tracks documents, notes, and checklist completion for easy embassy/NVC readiness.

6. **Progress is continuously tracked**
Rahvana auto-saves progress and lets users resume from where they stopped, so no work is lost.

7. **User gets expert help when needed**
User can book consultations and request support services (e.g., appointment booking, translation) to reduce risk before final submission/interview.

## 3) Full IR-1/CR-1 Journey (Sequence Summary)
1. **Stage I: USCIS Petition**
Check eligibility, gather relationship evidence, complete and submit I-130 package, wait for USCIS approval.

2. **Stage II: NVC / CEAC Processing**
Pay fees, fill DS-260, prepare/upload civil + financial documents (including I-864), wait for Documentarily Qualified status and interview letter.

3. **Stage III: Medical + Interview**
Complete medical exam, collect fresh police certificate and originals, prepare interview responses, attend embassy interview.

4. **Stage IV: Post-Interview & Travel**
Receive passport with visa, pay USCIS immigrant fee, verify visa details, prepare travel correctly.

5. **Stage V: U.S. Arrival**
Enter through port of entry, complete inspection, start post-arrival actions, receive green card, maintain status.

## 4) Why This Matters for Non-Technical Teams
- Easy to explain: one platform, one journey, clear checkpoints
- Easy to monitor: visible progress and completion status
- Easy to support: built-in tools + expert services
- Better outcomes: fewer missed steps and stronger interview readiness
